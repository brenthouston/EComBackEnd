# E-Com Back End
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)   
## Description
  In this project I built the back end for an E-commerce company by modifying starter code.  I worked with an Express.js API to get it to interact with a MySQL database using Sequilize.  By using Sequilize we optimized the code by not hardcoding the various MySQL queries necassary to serve this companies large product and tracking needs. In this project I created 15 CRUD routes, I used Insomnia to ensure my routes were working properly.
